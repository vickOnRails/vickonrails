Hi, I'm Victor - a Nigeria-based Frontend Engineer/Product Designer. I recently counted 3 years of designing & building interfaces on the web. It's been a great journey so far💪🏾.  

Here are a few things I'm currently learning about

🧰 Design Systems <br/>
🗺 Software Engineering Workflows <br/>
🤯 Web Standards & Future Web <br/>
👨🏾‍🦳 JavaScript (TypeScript) & recently C# <br/>
☁ cloud computing & serverless <br/>

I mostly work with ⚛ ReactJS & Friends (Emotion, Storybook, Ant Design, Jest, etc) on the frontend. Currently dipping my toes into fullstack development.

There's a lot to learn in so much little time and I honestly can't wait🔥. If you're as excited as I am, you could drop me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vick_OnRails) and let's be internet friends 😊
